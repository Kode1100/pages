            <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">Together with Egon Hollands (and a little help from @davetaz) we have created a
                visualisation of 4 main data sources:</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">The amount of aid given by the Netherlands to
                    recipient countries by date.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font: 13.0px Arial">Transparency International ‘Corruption Perceptions
                    Index’ by country, per year.</span></li>
            <li>
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">Gapminder World regions colors.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">Population data, by country from the World
                    Bank.</span>

        <p>
            <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">We have encountered the typical problems with data
                analysis:</span>

        <p><span style="font: 13.0px Arial">
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">First, the laptop has crashed for suspicious
                    reasons. We think it was the NSA.</span>
                <br clear="none" />
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">Secondly, we had to filter out data that was not
                    relevant to our scope (name of the project, countries not receiving aid
                    etc)</span>
                <br clear="none" />
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">Then we had to do the cleanup and refine:</span>
                <br clear="none" />
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">ensure that the dates and years were in a
                    compatible format</span>
                <br clear="none" />
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">manually fix some country names (North Korea
                    vs Democratic People's Republic of Korea vs Korea (North))</span>
                <br clear="none" />
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">then we had to aggregate the disbursements to each
                    country per year</span>
                <br clear="none" />
                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">we had to manually fix an error in the data for
                    Mali by cross-referencing with data from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs</span>

                <span style="font: 13.0px Arial">we had to estimate population for 2013 as the data
                    is not yet available from World Bank.</span>
